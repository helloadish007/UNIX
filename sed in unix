    sed is a “non-interactive” stream-oriented editor. Since its an “non-interactive” it can be used to automate editing if desired.
    The name sed is an abbreviation for stream editor, and the utility derives many of its commands from the ed line-editor (ed was the first UNIX text editor).
    This allows you to edit multiple files, or to perform common editing operations without ever having to open vi or emacs.
    sed reads from a file or from its standard input, and outputs to its standard output.
    sed has two buffers which are called pattern buffer and hold buffer. Both are initially empty.


1.TO DISPLAY A RANGE FROM A FILE.
