1) mkdir-->mkdir stands for “make directory.”

==> Create multiples directories in a single stretch:

(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ mkdir {t1,t2,t3}
(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ ls
t1  t2  t3
# here t1 t2 t3 are the directories

==>Building multiple sub directories using -p option:
    
      mkdir adds any missing parent directories in the process.
(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ mkdir -p hi/hello/123
(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ ls -R
.:
hi  t1  t2  t3

./hi:
hello

./hi/hello:
123

./hi/hello/123:

./t1:

./t2:

./t3:

Use ls -R to show the recursive directory tree.


==> setting permission using mkdir

The mkdir command by default gives rwx permissions for the current user only.
To add read, write, and execute permission for all users, add the -m option with the user 777 when creating a director

(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ mkdir -m777 perm
(base) adish@adish007:~/test$ ls -l
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 adish adish 4096 Aug 31 18:58 hi
drwxrwxrwx 2 adish adish 4096 Aug 31 19:04 perm
drwxr-xr-x 2 adish adish 4096 Aug 31 18:54 t1
drwxr-xr-x 2 adish adish 4096 Aug 31 18:54 t2
drwxr-xr-x 2 adish adish 4096 Aug 31 18:54 t3

#owner#group#other_users

To list all directories and show the permissions sets: -l

2) rm --> remove

# To delete files "one.txt", "two.txt", and "three.txt" from the current directory:
rm one.txt two.txt three.txt
 
# To delete all files in the current directory:
# WARNING Files can not be undeleted so be careful with the following command.
rm *
 
# To delete all files from the "$HOME/jon" directory:
rm $HOME/jon/*
 
# To recursively delete all files and sub-directories from "$HOME/jon/"
rm -rf $HOME/jon/*
 
# To delete files interactively (prompt for confirm):
rm -i *
 
# To delete all *.docx files (files ending with .docx extensions):
rm *.docx
 
# To delete all files in the current directory that have the string music in their file name:

# To delete all files that begin with a lower case letter z:
rm z*
 
# To delete all files in the current directory whose names, inclusive of any
# extensions, are exactly three characters in length:

# The following would tell the rm command to delete all files in the current
# directory that begin with the letter z and are six characters in length:
rm z?????
 
# To delete all files in the current directory that have a two-character
# filename extension:
rm *.??
 
# To delete all files in the current directory that have an A, B and/or C in
# them:
